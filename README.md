# TLE-Orbit-Propagator
Use of two line elements (TLE's) in order to propagate and simulate an orbit. Obtain different data such as keplerian elements, link budgets, etc. in a determined time of the simulation. This will all be included in a GUI that allows the user to choose different preset satellites, constellations and ground stations.
