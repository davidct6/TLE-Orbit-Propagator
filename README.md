1. Introduction
This project aims to simulate satellite constellation scenarios—such as LEO or GEO
constellations—using MATLAB, with a focus on orbit visualization, ground coverage
analysis, and communication link budget estimation. Users will interact with a GUI-driven
tool to simulate real-world constellations like GPS, GALILEO, or GLONASS, or input
individual satellites using Two-Line Element (TLE) data. The system will allow custom
placement of ground stations and analyze visibility, data coverage, and communication
performance between satellites and ground-based receivers.
